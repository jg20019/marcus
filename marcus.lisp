;;;; Parsing has two phases:
;;;; 1. In the first phase, lines of input are consumed and the block structure
;;;;    of the document - its division into paragraphs, block quotes, list items
;;;;    and so on is constructed. Text is assigned to these blocks but not parsed.
;;;;    Link reference definitions are parsed and a map of links is constructed.

  "Check if line matches ATX heading"
  (cl-ppcre:scan "^#{1,6}\\s+(\.+)$" line))

(defun scan-line (line) 
  (cond ((match-heading line) (list 'heading line))
        (t 'error)))

  (with-open-file (input path :direction :input)
